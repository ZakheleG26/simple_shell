Simple Shell

This simple shell project was done by myself, Zakhele Graham Gwamanda. This project is made up of 6 main tasks and 10 advanced task.

I declare that U have done the project on my own and there is no code that has been copied from any other learner. Initially it was a group tas but since I was not able to work with the partner because of vaious geographic reasons I have undertakedn the task on my own.
